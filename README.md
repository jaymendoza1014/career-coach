# Career-Coach
In this project I built an AI-driven career coaching assistant using Crew AI, an agent-based framework that allows for creation and collaboration of agents to execute taks. 
The goal of this project is to assist new grads with the navigation of the job market by providing: 

1. Personalized job reccomendations based on background
2. Salary insights
3. Identification of skill gaps and reccomendations of certifications to upskill
4. 6 month roadmap for student to follow to organize reccomendations and begin applying for jobs

This project consists of two agents, a Counselor and a Career Planner. The role of the Counselor is to take in student information such as a resume, and use it to conduct market research. The goal of the research is to uncover relevant jobs that the student can apply for as well as identify any skill gaps between those roles and the student. After identifying any skill gaps, the Counselor provides online coursework or certifications the student can attain to make themselves a better candidate. The Career Planner's role is to take the information provided by the student and the Counselor and create a 6 month roadmap for the student to follow. This roadmap organizes the students path and accounts for time to analyze roles they might be interested in, coursework they may need to take, and the actual application process for landing a role. This 6 month roadmap is designed to assist the student in landing a role within this time period.
